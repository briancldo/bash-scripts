### Problem
Ubuntu on VirutalBox often crashes or messes up and I lose all files.

### Alleviation

Fault tolerance:
giving a lot of disk space
periodically clearing up space

Make ubuntu starter environment script, in case of erasure:
- packages
  - fullscreen
  - docker
  - brew
  - sam

- applications: folder of .deb files & do sudo apt install ./*.deb
  - chrome
  - vscode
  - keepass
  - pycharm
  - discord


- reboot at the end
